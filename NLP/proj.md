I was getting bored yesterday and decided to do some basic exploratory data analysis on a dataset. Rather than going to Kaggle, I decided to find some insights about myself. So I found this open API available to get deep insights into your Instagram Profile. It is available at https://lnkd.in/d-3rjhg. I played around with the API and tweaked the test.py file a little to get the data I wanted to work on.
Then, I performed the analysis on my Instagram data to create a storyline covering following things:
1. Top Likers 
2. Geographical distribution of the photos uploaded by me on Instagram
3. Most Hashtags used by me while uploading the pictures/videos (leveraged NLTK library in python to create tokens, just for fun. The code is available at my GitHub Repo- https://lnkd.in/d9bhdmJ)
4. Trendline of likes and comments on my pictures for last 2 years
5.  Frequency distribution of Friend Suggestions based on different algorithms used by Instagram
6. Major Activities happening on my Instagram Feed

 Moreover, it was a nice experience to understand the power of RESTful APIs to access almost everything on Instagram with just a few requests.
