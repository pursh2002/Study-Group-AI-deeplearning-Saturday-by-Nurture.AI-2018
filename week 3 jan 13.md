In order to cater to a diverse audience, there will be 2 sessions every Saturday – you can attend both, 
one of them or none, it’s totally up to you! If you don’t want to attend the sessions, throughout the 
day there will be open hacking on creating open-source code implementations of the top research paper 
pre-prints that week. Or use that time to catch-up on lectures and readings (Afternoon sessions will be more
focused towards demo and hands on Coding !) while discussing with peers.
